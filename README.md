# Ghar-School
A project to help schools and parents communicate effectively.

## What is Ghar-School?
Ghar-School (घर-School) is a work-in-progress app designed to bridge the communication gap between parents and teachers. By providing a standardized platform, it simplifies the process of exchanging information and ensures seamless interaction between the two parties.

## Why was Ghar-School created?
This project was initiated for the Student Tech Expo at Annasaheb Dange Educational Campus, Ashta, Sangli, Maharashtra. 

### The Problem:
In today’s world, the communication between parents and teachers often suffers from delays or inconsistencies, as the information is usually passed through students. Even popular platforms like WhatsApp lack a standardized and dedicated method for this type of communication.

### The Solution:
Ghar-School aims to solve these challenges by:
- Providing a dedicated platform for parent-teacher communication.
- Ensuring clarity and consistency in messages.
- Reducing the reliance on students as intermediaries.
